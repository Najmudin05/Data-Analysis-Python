## [Project 1: Movies Analysis](https://github.com/Najmudin05/data-analysis-project-python/blob/main/Project_Movie_Analysis.ipynb)

### Project Overview 
This project utilizes a comprehensive movie dataset, developed as part of a Data Science Capstone Project, to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). The primary goal is to uncover trends in movies based on ratings, duration, and profit, and to examine the relationships among these three aspects.

### Data Source
The data is sourced from Kaggle and contains metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. This dataset also includes files containing 26 million ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies. Ratings are on a scale of 1-5 and were obtained from the official GroupLens website. This dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset).

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Understanding data
2. Data preparation (filtering and sorting data)
3. Handling duplicated and missing data
4. Feature engineering analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved exploring the movies dataset to answer key questions, such as:
1. What is the distribution of movies with a rating >3?
2. What is the distribution of the movie durations available?
3. Is there a relationship between the duration of the movie and the rating it received?
4. What is the distribution of profits generated by a movie?
5. Apakah ada hubungan antara profit dan rating?

### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. More than 50% of the data consists of movies with a rating above 3.
2. The average movie duration is around 94 minutes.
3. Movies with good ratings mostly have durations between 90–120 minutes.
4. Only 10% of all movies make a profit.
5. Movies with good ratings do not necessarily generate large profits.
6. Movies with a rating below 3 have profits below 1 billion.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
1. Focus on quality elements like storyline and cast to improve ratings and audience satisfaction.
2. Prioritize marketing for movies with high-profit potential, especially specific genres or themes that perform well.
3. Promote lower-rated movies by bundling them with popular titles or featuring them in “hidden gems” categories.
4. Investigate genre-specific trends to better understand what drives profitability in different categories.
